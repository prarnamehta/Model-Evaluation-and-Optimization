# Model-Evaluation-and-Optimization
The objective of this work is to:
- Build and evaluate 9 classifers including decision tree, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, Logistic regression, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, naïve Bayes and artificial neural network with two hidden layers to predict whether the passengers survived the sinking of the Titanic.
- Compare the performance of all the nine classifiers using ROC-AUC as well as confusion-matrix based performance evaluation measures. Select the “best performer” on the hold-out testset.
- Perform hyper-parameters tuning to optimize the “best performer” from the previous step using Randomized-search.
